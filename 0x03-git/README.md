Create a new directory called 0x03-git in your zero_day repo.

Make sure you include a not empty README.md in your directory:

at the root of your repository zero_day
AND in the directory 0x03-git
And important part: Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.
